OPENAI_AGENTS_SDK
A lightweight and flexible project leveraging the OpenAI Agents SDK to build intelligent, multi-agent AI workflows. This repository provides tools, examples, and utilities to create agentic AI applications using Python, with support for the OpenAI Responses and Chat Completions APIs.
Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the OpenAI Agents SDK to create scalable, multi-agent systems capable of performing complex tasks through agent orchestration, tool integration, and handoffs. It is designed to be provider-agnostic, supporting OpenAI models and potentially other LLMs via integrations like LiteLLM.
Key features include:

Agent Configuration: Define agents with custom instructions, tools, and guardrails.
Handoffs: Enable seamless transfer of control between agents for specialized tasks.
Guardrails: Validate inputs and outputs to ensure safe and reliable operations.
Tracing: Built-in observability to debug and optimize agent workflows.

Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
git clone https://github.com/Ahmed11Raza/OPENAI_AGENTS_SDK.git
cd OPENAI_AGENTS_SDK
pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. You’ll also need an OpenAI API key, which you can obtain from platform.openai.com.
Set your API key as an environment variable:
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"

For voice support (optional), install the voice group:
pip install 'openai-agents[voice]'

Usage
The repository includes example scripts to demonstrate the capabilities of the OpenAI Agents SDK. Below is a basic example of creating and running an agent.
from agents import Agent, Runner

# Define an agent
agent = Agent(
    name="HaikuAssistant",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant that writes haikus."
)

# Run the agent
result = Runner.run_sync(agent, "Write a haiku about the moon.")
print(result.final_output)

For more examples, check the examples/ directory, which includes demonstrations of multi-agent workflows, tool integration, and guardrail configurations.

Features

Multi-Agent Workflows: Orchestrate multiple agents to handle complex tasks collaboratively.
Tool Integration: Use Python functions as tools with automatic schema generation and validation.
Handoffs: Dynamically transfer control between agents for specialized task handling.
Guardrails: Implement input and output validation to ensure safe interactions.
Tracing: Visualize and debug agent execution with built-in tracing support.
