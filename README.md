OPENAI_AGENTS_SDK

This project is a lightweight and flexible framework for building intelligent, multi-agent AI systems using the OpenAI Agents SDK. It provides tools and utilities to create scalable AI applications with features like agent orchestration, tool integration, and handoffs, designed for developers working with AI-driven workflows.

Overview

The OPENAI_AGENTS_SDK project enables developers to create multi-agent systems that perform complex tasks through collaboration, validation, and observability. It supports integration with OpenAI’s APIs and is designed to be provider-agnostic, potentially supporting other language models via compatible frameworks.

Key features include:





Multi-agent workflows for collaborative task execution.



Tool integration for extending agent capabilities.



Handoffs for dynamic task delegation between agents.



Guardrails to ensure safe and reliable inputs and outputs.



Tracing for debugging and optimizing workflows.

Workflow Description

The following outlines the process for creating and running a multi-agent system in this project. You can visualize this as a flowchart using tools like Draw.io or Lucidchart by representing steps as shapes (ovals for start/end, rectangles for actions, diamonds for decisions) connected by arrows.





Initialize Agent System: Start by setting up the environment, including loading API keys and dependencies.



Define Agent(s): Configure agents with specific properties, such as names, instructions, and associated tools, using models like GPT-4o.



Assign Tools: Attach custom tools or functions to agents, ensuring proper validation of inputs and outputs.



Multi-Agent Workflow?: Decide if the task requires multiple agents for collaboration.





If Yes: Configure handoffs to define how control transfers between agents, then proceed to input the task.



If No: Move directly to inputting the task.



Input Task: Provide the user query or task, such as generating text or performing a calculation.



Apply Guardrails: Validate the input to ensure it meets safety and compliance standards.



Run Agent(s): Execute the agent workflow, leveraging the OpenAI API to process the task.



Handoff Required?: Check if another agent needs to take over to continue the task.





If Yes: Return to running the next agent.



If No: Proceed to generating the output.



Generate Output: Produce the final result, such as text, data, or tool outputs.



Apply Output Guardrails: Validate the output to ensure it is safe and meets quality standards.



Log Tracing Data: Record details of the workflow for debugging and optimization.



Return Result: Deliver the final output to the user or system.

Visualization Tip: To create a flowchart, use a tool like Draw.io. Represent actions as blue rectangles, decisions as yellow diamonds, and start/end points as green ovals. Connect steps with arrows to show the flow. Save the diagram as a PNG or SVG to include in this README.

Installation

To use this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Ensure Python 3.8 or higher is installed. You’ll need an OpenAI API key, obtainable from the OpenAI platform. Optionally, additional packages can be installed for voice support.

Usage

The project includes example workflows in a dedicated directory, showcasing multi-agent systems, tool integration, and handoffs. These examples demonstrate how to set up agents to perform tasks like generating creative content or processing data, with built-in validation and tracing.
